## The BrainGrid Project

The original idea behind the BrainGrid Project is to develop a toolkit/software architecture to ease creating high-performance neural network simulators. It is now composed of two parts BrainGrid (the simulator) and Workbench (a simulation and data/software provenance tool). So, we now say that BrainGrid+Workbench focuses on enabling **high-performance/high-quality** neural simulation. Its key features:
- Its target audience are researchers who need higher performance than that made available by general-purpose simulators, those that use Python, etc. and who are therefore considering writing their own simulation code in C/C++.
- Its target application is large scale and long duration neural simulations.
- It provides a C++ programming interface that focuses new coding just on the core implementation of neuron, synapse, etc. state updates.
- It assumes that an investigator will first want to implement small and/or short duration simulations that run as a single thread on a CPU, to provide validation data to increase confidence in result validity (this is part of the "high quality" theme).
- It provides a programming interface to minimize code changes needed to port the simulation to single or multiple GPUs. In effect, we've already optimized the simulator for GPUs (this addresses the "high performance" aspect).
- We provide a (Java based) Workbench that allows the investigator to download, build, and run the simulator; the Workbench captures all software and data provenance information, so that later the investigator can compare different results generated at different times and see how they differ in terms of not only their input parameters but also their simulator versions. This helps one to determine whether two simulations are comparable, whether one or more are invalid due to simulator bugs, etc. (This also connects to the idea of "high quality".)
